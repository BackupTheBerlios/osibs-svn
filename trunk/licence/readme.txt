The files under the following folders are not part of the project itself but used. 
for your convenience I added the files so you dont need to find them yourself and 
run into a version issue.
For the licence check the licence within thoe files as well. they are all open source but may 
differ from the GPL which the main project is released under.

The folders in question are

ComTools
QMapControl
SerialPort

Also this is a work in progress release. The project status is called BETA which it is but the 
whole thing is still under some heavy changes as some main features are stil missing in the 
public branch for now. They are still under development.


Finaly and help is welcomed to the project. For the C++ QT part as well as for the Firmware 
which does the inflight calculations. Be my guest if you like to join.
